MediaX
======

MediaX is a media index application.
It reads a directory and presents it in a simple HTML page.
The directory must follow a simple convention which is:
media_root_directory
 |_media_directory
   |_any_number_of_files
   |_cover.(png|jpg|gif|wathever)

Mediax will walk the media_root_directory and create an entry for each media_directory within this.
It will genenrate a thumbnail from the cover.(png|jpg|etc) file within each media_directory, and will assume the name of these directories as the media title.

Example:
movies
 |_12 monkeys
 |  |_cover.png
 |_The mothman prophecies
    |_cover.png

Will get two entries:
 - 12 monkeys
 - The mothman prophecies

Each one with its own thumbnail.
